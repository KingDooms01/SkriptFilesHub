# What is Skript Files Hub?
Skript Files Hub (Also known as S.F.H.) is a Skript file that lets you download files easily into your scripts folder.
All you have to do is load the data in and check the GUI to check any of the Skripts.
# How to upload your files onto the skript?
If you want a file on the list, you must create a link to a raw version of the file, recommended to do this in either using [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/). But first, you need to follow this format.
